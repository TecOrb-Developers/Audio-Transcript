recently, your work's been a bit off.你知道我在说什么吧 
You know what I'm talking about?我猜神速力里发生的故事

you gotta hold on to it.无论谁阻止你
No matter who's trying to stop you.我对这点深信不疑
That's clear to me now.我觉得你对你儿子有些太过严厉了
I think you're being a little tough on your son.什么
Excuse me?他为什么不马上告诉你 显而易见嘛
Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.看看你现在的反应
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.也许你只要静下心来... 听听他解释
Maybe if you just listen and... and hear his reasons试着设身处地为他考虑...
and try to see things from his point of view...也许... 也许你就能理解为什么
maybe... maybe you'd understand why他从前会...
he didn't tell you...瞒着你
before now.宝贝女儿 这一切...
