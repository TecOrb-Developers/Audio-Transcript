1
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,866
On a night like this,you came into the world.

2
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,157
I remember that storm.

3
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,907
All the dogs in King's Landing

4
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,907
howled through the night.

5
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,533
I wish I could remember it.

6
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,449
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

7
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,241
Doesn't feel like home.

8
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,575
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

9
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:42,976
Good.

10
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,116
Not so many lions.

11
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:49,032
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

12
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,324
The lords of Westeros despise her.

13
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,199
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

14
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,700
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

15
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,324
They drink secret toasts to my health?

16
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,283
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

17
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,325
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

18
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:13,157
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

19
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,157
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

20
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,741
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

21
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:20,158
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

22
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,907
No.

23
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:25,157
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

24
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,032
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

25
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,616
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

26
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,700
the game is won.

27
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,157
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

28
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,324
we have powerful allies in the south.

29
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:40,907
I never properly thanked you for that.

30
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,658
They joined our side, my queen,

31
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,199
because they believe in you.

32
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,534
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

33
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,157
I did.

34
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:52,491
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

35
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,241
I had a choice, Your Grace...

36
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,366
serve Robert Baratheon or
face the headman's axe.

37
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,700
But you didn't serve him long.

38
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,158
You turned against him.

39
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,324
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

40
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,408
There have been few rulers in history

41
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,491
as cruel as the Mad King.

42
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,949
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

43
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,491
He simply had no interest in being king.

44
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,199
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,408
Your Grace,

46
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,408
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

47
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,449
Lord Varys told me about a
queen in the east who...

48
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,367
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

49
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:32,074
All your spies, your little birds,

50
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,742
did they tell you Viserys was
cruel, stupid, and weak?

51
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:42,366
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

52
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,032
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

53
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,533
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

54
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,866
and that you were said to be beautiful.

55
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:53,575
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

56
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,575
Which you turned to your advantage.

57
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,617
Who gave the order to kill me?

58
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,658
King Robert.

59
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,408
Who hired the assassins?

60
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,575
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

61
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,350
Your Grace, I did what
had to be done to...

62
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:14,116
To keep yourself alive.

63
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,408
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

64
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,199
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,907
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

66
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,324
What kind of a servant is that?

67
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,449
The kind the realm needs.

68
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,825
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

69
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,784
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

70
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,491
I wasn't born into a great house.

71
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:39,074
I came from nothing.

72
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:42,032
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

73
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,866
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

74
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,449
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

75
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,658
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

76
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,616
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

77
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,992
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

78
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,700
If you demand blind allegiance,

79
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,449
I respect your wishes.

80
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,449
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

81
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,032
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

82
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,324
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

83
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,825
because I choose you.

84
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:22,367
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

85
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,826
Swear this to me, Varys.

86
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:37,783
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

87
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,991
you won't conspire behind my back.

88
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:42,949
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,784
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

90
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,784
I swear it, my queen.

91
00:06:56,117 --> 00:07:00,032
And I swear this... if
you ever betray me,

92
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,742
I'll burn you alive.

93
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,492
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

94
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,533
Forgive me, my queen.

95
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,701
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

96
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,627
_

97
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,457
_

98
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,299
_

99
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,057
_

100
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:41,369
_

101
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:44,409
_

102
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,219
_

103
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,896
_

104
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,223
_

105
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:56,783
She once served another who
wanted the Iron Throne.

106
00:07:56,784 --> 00:08:00,700
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

107
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,366
No, it didn't.

108
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,199
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

109
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,074
We've just decided to pardon those

110
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,742
who once served the wrong king.

111
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,074
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

112
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,741
Not yet, but even those who
don't worship the Lord

113
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,241
can serve his cause.

114
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,158
What does your lord expect from me?

115
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,492
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

116
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,783
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

117
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,366
Your Grace, forgive me,

118
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,324
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

119
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,074
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

120
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:47,032
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

121
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:51,408
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

122
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,575
Doesn't really roll off
the tongue, does it?

123
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,117
No, but I like it better.

124
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,658
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

125
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,449
Prophecies are dangerous things.

126
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,783
I believe you have a role to play.

127
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,658
As does another...

128
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,158
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

129
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,866
Jon Snow?

130
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,658
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

131
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,825
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

132
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,949
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

133
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,658
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

134
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,575
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

135
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,825
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

136
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,907
to protect them from grave danger.

137
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,491
As King in the North,

138
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,324
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

139
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,825
so together they may
face their common enemy.

140
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,949
He sounds like quite a man.

141
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,324
Summon Jon Snow.

142
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,991
Let him stand before you

143
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,616
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

144
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:50,242
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

145
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,408
I can't speak to prophecies

146
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,032
or visions in the flames,

147
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,825
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

148
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,324
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

149
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,783
If he does rule the North,

150
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,534
he would make a valuable ally.

151
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,783
The Lannisters executed his father

152
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,949
and conspired to murder his brother.

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,158
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

154
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,324
Very well.

155
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,116
Send a raven north.

156
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,116
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

157
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,116
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

158
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,867
and bend the knee.

159
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,408
Gather round. Come here.

160
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,907
You think it's really Tyrion?

161
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:47,408
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

162
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,949
Read the last bit.

163
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,575
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

164
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,324
What does that mean?

165
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:58,242
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

166
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,409
You know him better than any of us.

167
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:03,976
What do you think?

168
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,658
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

169
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,449
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

170
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,449
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

171
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,949
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

172
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,116
Join us.

173
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,950
Together, we can end her tyranny."

174
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,116
Sounds like a charmer.

175
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:29,324
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

176
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:32,283
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

177
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,826
a bit less charming.

178
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,991
What?

179
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:40,241
Fire kills wights, you told me.

180
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,642
What breathes fire?

181
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:45,616
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

182
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,032
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

183
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,991
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

184
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,492
do we have enough men to fight them?

185
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:00,199
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

186
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,117
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

187
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,366
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

188
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,491
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

189
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,700
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

190
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,199
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

191
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,991
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

192
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:24,157
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

193
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,366
rape and enslave your women,

194
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,283
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

195
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:34,157
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

196
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:36,991
You all remember the Mad King.

197
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,533
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

198
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,533
His daughter is no different.

199
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,324
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

200
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:49,616
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

201
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,283
And when she grew bored of that,

202
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,533
she fed them to her dragons.

203
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,116
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

204
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:01,283
But I need your help, my lords.

205
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:04,075
We must stand together, all of us...

206
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,283
if we hope to stop her.

207
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,701
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

208
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,866
The same as Aegon when he conquered

209
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,366
the Seven Kingdoms.

210
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,742
How do you propose to stop them?

211
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:31,534
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

212
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,809
Lord Tarly.

213
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,157
Ser Jaime.

214
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,866
I believe you know my son.

215
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,867
Ser Jaime.

216
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,366
Rickard, isn't it?

217
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,074
Dickon.

218
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:50,616
That's it.

219
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,616
Thank you for coming.

220
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:56,533
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

221
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,241
They might not have come if you hadn't.

222
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:01,533
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

223
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:04,325
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,575
You ride for Horn Hill today?

225
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:12,283
I have an army to mobilize.

226
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,616
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

227
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:17,075
And which side will you be fighting for?

228
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,408
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

229
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,324
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

230
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,283
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

231
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,241
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

232
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,366
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

233
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,366
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

234
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,199
All her enemies.

235
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,242
Including Olenna Tyrell.

236
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,491
I'm a Tarly.

237
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,992
That name means something.

238
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,032
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

239
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,491
We don't stab our rivals in the back

240
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,325
or cut their throats at weddings.

241
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,366
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

242
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,701
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

243
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,491
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

244
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:09,116
She was a great woman once.

245
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,491
Now she's broken.

246
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,616
She wants revenge so badly,

247
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:15,866
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

248
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:19,784
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

249
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,700
I know you don't like my sister,

250
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,866
but you have to make a choice.

251
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,907
Do you fight with us

252
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,033
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

253
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,533
When the war is won,

254
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:42,700
the queen will need a new
Warden of the South.

255
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,533
I can think of no better man

256
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,367
than Randyll Tarly.

257
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,199
The infection
has spread too far.

258
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,158
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

259
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:59,267
How long?

260
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,866
It'll be years before it kills you.

261
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,449
Could be 10.

262
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,116
Could be 20.

263
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,867
But how long until...?

264
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,366
Your mind?

265
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,242
Six months, maybe fewer.

266
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,308
Um...

267
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:33,741
Pardon, Archmaester.

268
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,741
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

269
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,199
She had the greyscale as
a baby and was cured.

270
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,783
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

271
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,575
Does this look
like a baby to you?

272
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:43,907
- No.
- Have you studied

273
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,949
the varying rates of
greyscale progression

274
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,576
in infants and fully grown men?

275
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,017
No.

276
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:54,366
Maester Cressen discovered

277
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,950
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

278
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,117
This is quite advanced.

279
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,158
And beyond our skills, ser.

280
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:10,575
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

281
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,116
to live out your life
with the stone men.

282
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:16,950
As an anointed knight, I'll
allow you one more day.

283
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,284
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

284
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:30,184
Come, Samwell.

285
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,534
Should we send word to
your family, Ser...?

286
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,558
Jorah.

287
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,491
Jorah Mormont.

288
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:45,533
Mormont?

289
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:47,283
There's no need.

290
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,867
I've been dead to them for years.

291
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,200
Come, Samwell!

292
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:09,074
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

293
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,576
No, I can't say I have.

294
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:16,283
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

295
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:20,241
Curious that King Robert did
not have them destroyed.

296
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:22,408
They were his trophies.

297
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,616
He couldn't keep them around.

298
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,533
They would have made him look small.

299
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:29,075
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

300
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,242
I believe he brought his
whores on occasion.

301
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,367
Balerion the Dread.

302
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,783
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

303
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,700
His flames forged the Iron Throne

304
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,576
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

305
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:56,142
Powerful...

306
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,450
but not invincible.

307
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,241
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

308
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:09,908
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

309
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,741
And if they can be wounded,

310
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,142
they can be killed.

311
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,408
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

312
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,242
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

313
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,284
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

314
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,284
If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

315
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,449
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

316
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,116
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

317
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,616
The city will fall within a day.

318
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,533
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

319
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,116
It's called war.

320
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,116
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

321
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,449
I know how you wage war.

322
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,199
We don't poison little girls here.

323
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,491
Myrcella was innocent.

324
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:16,866
She was a Lannister.

325
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,491
There are no innocent Lannisters.

326
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,783
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

327
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,658
That's enough.

328
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,241
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

329
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,659
You will treat him with respect.

330
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:34,659
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

331
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,074
That's very nice to hear.

332
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,032
Of course, I can't remember a queen

333
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,991
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

334
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,949
The common people loved her.

335
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,700
The nobles loved her.

336
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,449
And what is left of her now?

337
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,283
Ashes.

338
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,991
Commoners, nobles,

339
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:54,866
they're all just children, really.

340
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:58,492
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

341
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,741
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

342
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,658
I'm grateful to all of you.

343
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:07,283
But you have chosen to follow me.

344
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,658
I will not attack King's Landing.

345
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,491
We will not attack King's Landing.

346
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:16,157
Then how do you mean to
take the Iron Throne?

347
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,558
By asking nicely?

348
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,032
We will lay siege to the capital,

349
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,741
surrounding the city on all sides.

350
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,533
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

351
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,907
but no food for her army or the people.

352
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,825
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

353
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,866
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

354
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,533
by appealing to their loyalty,

355
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,199
their love for their country.

356
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,116
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

357
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:38,825
we prove her point.

358
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:40,449
Our army should be Westerosi.

359
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,741
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

360
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,032
You are.

361
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:47,409
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

362
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:53,408
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

363
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,408
back up to King's Landing.

364
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,241
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

365
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:00,283
alongside the Tyrell army.

366
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,949
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

367
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,074
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

368
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:11,450
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

369
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,949
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

370
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,533
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

371
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:23,700
And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

372
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,616
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

373
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:28,492
will sail for the Rock and take it.

374
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,659
Do I have your support?

375
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,850
You have mine.

376
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:55,492
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

377
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,158
Thank you all.

378
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,492
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

379
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,866
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

380
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:21,783
But I swear to you, she will
pay for what she's done.

381
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:24,449
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

382
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,491
Peace?

383
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,157
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

384
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,283
Or his father? Or his?

385
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,949
Peace never lasts, my dear.

386
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,284
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

387
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,283
He's a clever man, your Hand.

388
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:45,116
I've known a great many clever men.

389
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:47,032
I've outlived them all.

390
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,949
You know why?

391
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,491
I ignored them.

392
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,991
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

393
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,392
Are you a sheep?

394
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,700
No.

395
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,991
You're a dragon.

396
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:02,534
Be a dragon.

397
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:08,866
Mají.

398
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:14,992
You leave tomorrow.

399
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,241
Were you going to say goodbye?

400
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:22,866
I will see you when I return.

401
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:24,742
But you don't know when that will be.

402
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,142
No one knows.

403
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:32,576
I wish you good fortune.

404
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,475
Missandei.

405
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,074
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

406
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,283
Why?

407
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,949
You know why.

408
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,350
I don't.

409
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,701
Y-you are my weakness.

410
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,157
That's what I am?

411
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:02,616
Your weakness?

412
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:06,325
When Unsullied are young, the
masters learn their fears.

413
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:10,283
One boy is scared of dogs,

414
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,157
one boy hates high places,

415
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,991
one is frightened of the ocean.

416
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,449
They make the boy sleep with dogs

417
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,366
or climb a cliff.

418
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,658
They throw him in the water.

419
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,949
If he learns to swim, good.

420
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,908
If he drowns, good.

421
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:30,116
Either way, strong Unsullied.

422
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:32,533
But I had no fears.

423
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:36,325
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

424
00:25:37,908 --> 00:25:40,992
but I was bravest, always.

425
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,408
- I believe it.
- Until...

426
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,200
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

427
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:52,992
Now I have fear.

428
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:00,017
I do, too.

429
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,033
No.

430
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,242
I want to see you.

431
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:23,017
Please.

432
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:56,949
Might be useful.

433
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,825
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

434
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,658
but an excellent researcher.

435
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,116
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

436
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,991
Maester Faull was quite the opposite...

437
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,741
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

438
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,366
Um, I wanted to ask you...

439
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,157
If you're going to write
histories, Tarly,

440
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,741
you have to do the research.

441
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:14,616
If you want people to
read your histories,

442
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,866
you need a bit of style.

443
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,866
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars

444
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,700
Following the Death of King Robert I"

445
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,992
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

446
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,826
What? You don't like the title?

447
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,366
What would you call it, then?

448
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,700
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

449
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:36,449
We're not poets, Tarly.

450
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,616
Um, Archmaester, if I
could just have a moment.

451
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,366
This is your moment.

452
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,826
Use it wisely.

453
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,826
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

454
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,199
There are two recorded cases

455
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,032
of advanced greyscale being cured.

456
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,866
I found the procedure in
the study of rare diseases

457
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,199
by Archmaester Pylos.

458
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,366
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

459
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,324
and his study of rare diseases.

460
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,324
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

461
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,242
And shall I tell you how he died?

462
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:04,809
From greyscale.

463
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,408
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

464
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:09,809
which is why it's now forbidden.

465
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:55,408
Hello.

466
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:57,950
What are you doing?

467
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,491
You're Jorah Mormont,

468
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,450
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

469
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:06,575
My name is Samwell Tarly,

470
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:08,366
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

471
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,157
training to serve as
maester at Castle Black.

472
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:12,449
I knew your father.

473
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,950
I was with him when he died.

474
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,158
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

475
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:29,783
Drink this.

476
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:31,575
- What is it?
- Rum.

477
00:31:31,576 --> 00:31:33,736
Drink it all, please. I'm
afraid this is going to hurt.

478
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:56,826
If you could take off your shirt.

479
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:13,701
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

480
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,157
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

481
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:19,398
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

482
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,867
Have you ever done this before?

483
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,725
No.

484
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,576
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

485
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,534
Have a seat.

486
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:49,449
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

487
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,742
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

488
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:07,575
Shh, shh!

489
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:09,825
Shh.

490
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:12,241
Again, I'm sorry,

491
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,742
but please try not to scream.

492
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,074
They say her dragons are
bigger than Aegon's.

493
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:18,825
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

494
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:20,408
I hope it's true.

495
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,449
If she lays siege to King's
Landing, prices will triple.

496
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,825
As long as we get back
there before they start.

497
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:29,367
One more round. It's a long ride.

498
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:32,825
Arry!

499
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:34,226
Hello, Hot Pie.

500
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,725
Sit down.

501
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:40,184
Who's that for?

502
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:50,534
Mm. This is good.

503
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:53,991
You think so?

504
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,741
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

505
00:34:56,742 --> 00:34:59,700
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

506
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,324
Mm, I didn't do that.

507
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,866
You've been making pies?

508
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,199
One or two.

509
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,199
I can't believe you're here.

510
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,658
Did you meet the big lady?

511
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:12,658
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

512
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:14,866
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

513
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,700
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

514
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,200
Did she ever find you?

515
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:23,184
She found me.

516
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,850
What happened to you, Arry?

517
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
You got any ale?

518
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:58,741
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

519
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,241
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

520
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,825
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

521
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,408
That must have been something to see.

522
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,199
- Boom.
- Mm.

523
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,408
I can't believe someone would do that.

524
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:09,950
Cersei would do that.

525
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:15,157
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

526
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:17,283
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

527
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:19,742
No, the Boltons are dead.

528
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:23,116
What?

529
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,283
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

530
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,074
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

531
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:28,492
He's King of the North now.

532
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,283
You're lying.

533
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:33,157
Why would I lie about that?

534
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,617
He's your brother, right?

535
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,949
Thanks for the pie.

536
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,866
Friends don't pay.

537
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:48,157
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

538
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:50,075
You're pretty.

539
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:52,684
Thanks.

540
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,701
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

541
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,491
Try not to get killed.

542
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:03,907
Ah, I won't.

543
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,157
I'm like you, Arry.

544
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,826
I'm a survivor.

545
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,158
200 miles to King's Landing.

546
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,826
One bottle of rum. You
think we'll make it?

547
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:52,575
Come in.

548
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:56,033
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

549
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,575
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

550
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:11,907
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

551
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:16,449
a man I trust as much as
anyone in this world.

552
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,241
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

553
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:22,074
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

554
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:30,408
I received this a few days ago

555
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,033
from Dragonstone.

556
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:36,032
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

557
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:41,408
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

558
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:45,449
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

559
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,366
She has a powerful army at her back

560
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:51,241
and, if this message is to be believed,

561
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,533
three dragons.

562
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:57,283
Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

563
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:59,033
to meet with Daenerys.

564
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,783
And I'm going to accept.

565
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:03,184
Accept?!

566
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:09,575
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

567
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,533
We know that dragonglass can destroy

568
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:13,449
both white walkers and their army.

569
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,992
We need to mine it and
turn it into weapons.

570
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,366
But more importantly, we need allies!

571
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:24,658
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

572
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,408
We can't defeat them on our own.

573
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,241
We don't have the numbers.

574
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:31,949
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

575
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,241
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

576
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,366
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

577
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,783
then sail for Dragonstone.

578
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:43,700
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

579
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,907
The Mad King invited
him to King's Landing

580
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:48,199
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

581
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,324
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

582
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,324
The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

583
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:56,157
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

584
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:59,449
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

585
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,825
You know him. He's a good man.

586
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:05,658
Your Grace, with respect, I
must agree with Lady Sansa.

587
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:08,741
I remember the Mad King all too well.

588
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,491
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

589
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,700
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

590
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,157
Aye. We called your brother king.

591
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:21,074
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

592
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:24,866
Winter is here, Your Grace.

593
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,741
We need the King in the
North in the North.

594
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:31,075
Aye!

595
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,826
You all crowned me your king.

596
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:46,032
I never wanted it.

597
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,491
I never asked for it.

598
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:52,783
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

599
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:57,074
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

600
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,492
no matter the odds.

601
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,158
But the odds are against us.

602
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:09,366
None of you have seen the Army
of the Dead. None of you.

603
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:13,408
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

604
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:16,409
We need allies, powerful allies.

605
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,242
I know it's a risk.

606
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,449
But I have to take it.

607
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,199
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

608
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,741
Daenerys is a queen.

609
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:31,074
Only a king can convince her to help us.

610
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,866
It has to be me.

611
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,825
You're abandoning your people!

612
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,616
You're abandoning your home.

613
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,533
I'm leaving both in good hands.

614
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:39,950
- Whose?
- Yours.

615
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,449
You are my sister.

616
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,533
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

617
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:49,450
Until I return, the North is yours.

618
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:14,576
I delivered
his bones myself.

619
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,741
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

620
00:42:17,742 --> 00:42:20,242
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

621
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:23,075
Seems like a lifetime ago.

622
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:27,409
Do give Lord Tyrion my
best when you see him.

623
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:32,783
I was sorry when he died.

624
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:36,492
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

625
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:40,701
So did I.

626
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:45,158
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

627
00:42:47,075 --> 00:42:50,117
Well, it appears she
vastly underestimated you.

628
00:42:52,242 --> 00:42:53,575
Your father and brothers are gone,

629
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:55,617
yet here you stand, King in the North.

630
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,325
Last best hope against the coming storm.

631
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,492
You don't belong down here.

632
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,284
Forgive me.

633
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:14,533
We haven't ever talked... properly.

634
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,033
I wanted to remedy that.

635
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,200
I have nothing to say to you.

636
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,283
Not even "thank you"?

637
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:27,533
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

638
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:30,908
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

639
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:35,575
I love Sansa,

640
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:37,241
as I loved her mother.

641
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:51,075
Touch my sister, and
I'll kill you myself.

642
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,701
- Ready?
- Ready?

643
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:23,767
Ready!

644
00:44:27,242 --> 00:44:28,642
Come on.

645
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,117
- Yah!
- Come on!

646
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,032
Nymeria?

647
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:42,742
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

648
00:46:47,826 --> 00:46:50,075
I'm heading north, girl.

649
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,117
Back to Winterfell. I'm
finally going home.

650
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,059
Come with me.

651
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:11,534
Come with me.

652
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:41,284
That's not you.

653
00:47:57,158 --> 00:48:00,116
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

654
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:01,533
I'm oldest.

655
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:03,658
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

656
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,658
She's not my mama.

657
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:07,741
You can have Cersei.

658
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:10,283
I want the Mountain.

659
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:12,408
The Mountain killed Father.

660
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,157
He'll crush you with one hand.

661
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,907
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

662
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:19,116
Will you shut up about Mama?

663
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:20,700
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

664
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:24,575
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

665
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:26,117
And then I won't have to share.

666
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,017
"Mama!"

667
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,825
How can you drink this piss?

668
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:35,949
When we reach Sunspear,

669
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,491
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

670
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:40,907
The best in the world.

671
00:48:40,908 --> 00:48:42,324
Have you ever been to Dorne?

672
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:44,324
A few times.

673
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:45,700
Never stayed long.

674
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,242
A boy in every port?

675
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,826
A boy, a girl.

676
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,767
Depends on the port.

677
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,576
Could we get some more?

678
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,741
I thought it wasn't for you.

679
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:04,033
I'm developing a taste for it.

680
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,826
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

681
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:14,533
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

682
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,366
Once I kill my uncle.

683
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,825
And what will you be, handsome?

684
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,533
Whatever my queen commands.

685
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:24,366
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

686
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,616
Oh, I see.

687
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:28,033
Your protector.

688
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:32,324
So, if someone gets too close to you...

689
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:34,116
He might have to intervene.

690
00:49:34,117 --> 00:49:35,907
To hold that person back.

691
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:38,576
Until they've made their
intentions known.

692
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,910
Why are you standing all
the way over there, then?

693
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:47,491
A foreign invasion is underway.

694
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:49,242
Leave him be.

695
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:54,617
Seems like you don't need a protector.

696
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:01,809
Stay here.

697
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,492
We're under attack!

698
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:31,242
Euron.

699
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:41,492
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

700
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,074
Aah!

701
00:52:48,908 --> 00:52:50,308
Yah!

702
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:57,059
Aah!

703
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:16,226
Yah!

704
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:19,017
Yah!

705
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:38,658
Kill us.

706
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,117
Get it over with.

707
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,325
Give your uncle a kiss.

708
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:45,075
Little Theon!

709
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:02,075
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

710
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,825
I have her.

711
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,409
Come and get her.
