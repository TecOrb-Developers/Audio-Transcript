What just happened to him?

Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.

It's okay, we're going home.

What Wally saw, it's gonna haunt him for a while.

I proposed because I thought it would save you.

- What does that mean? - I think we need some space.
 
I owe you the truth. My name is Mon-El.
 
I'm the former Prince of Daxam.
 
I deserve better than being lied to.
 
I've been looking for you.
 
Toodles!
 
I told you.
 
Everything's better in song.
 
When you speak, it's just words.
 
But when you sing, you open up your soul
 
and let who you really are shine through.
 
Thanks, Mom.
 
Hmm. I love you, my beautiful boy.
 
I love you too.

This...
 
again?
 
What, are you gonna spend the rest of your life
 
sitting around on the couch? Come on.
 
You've been doing this for days. Let's do something.
 
- Let's go out. - No, man, I'm sorry.
 
I... I don't feel like going out.
 
What is it with you and musicals these days anyhow?
 
Everything's better in song.
 
Listen, dude,
 
I know you've been going through a tough time
 
since Iris broke off the engagement,
 
- or, I guess... - What?
 
... technically, since you broke off the engagement.
 
Whoever broke off the engagement,
 
it doesn't matter, I just...
 
I don't know, man. I want to help.
 
Nothing you can really do.
 
Really? I guess I'm just gonna have to let...
 
Mr. Gene Kelly take over
 
'cause, Lord knows, I can't do anything about that.
 
- It's H.R. - Yeah.
 
B.A.,
 
someone's coming through.
 
Could be Gypsy.
 
Could be, or it could be...
 
Supergirl?
 
Kara...
 
- What happened to her? - We don't know,
 
but whoever did it has come to this world.
 
Her vitals are low.
 
How long has she been like this?
 
A few hours.
 
Okay, we need to find whoever did this to Kara
 
and punch him repeatedly until he reverses
 
whatever spell he put on her,
 
and I get to punch him first.
 
Who are you exactly?
 
My name is Mon-El.
 
I'm... I'm Kara's...

 
friend.
 
We're more... more than friend.
 
We've been kissing a lot.
 
Oh, she never mentioned she had a boyfriend.
 
It's a recent thing, so...
 
I thought you two broke up.
 
I tell you what, I know enough not to mention
 
the break-up between Barry and... uh...
 
- H.R. - Sorry.
 
Look, hey, whatever's going on between me and Kara,
 
I cannot leave her like this, okay?
 
- I need to get her back. - We will, I promise.
 
So what happened to her?
 
An alien prisoner escaped our custody.
 
He did something to her, put her in some kind of a coma.
 
And then he disappeared.
 
We tracked him here and followed.
 
Okay, but why would he come to this Earth?
 
Well, we believe... for you.
 
- Me? Why? - We don't know.
 
But his last words before he disappeared
 
were about finding the fastest man alive.
 
Okay, well, clearly, we're talking about a breacher here.
 
And if there's one thing I can do,
 
it's find breachers.
 
So what else can you tell us about this guy?
 
Not much.

It's like he just materialized out of thin air.
 
You mean like this clown just did?
 
I'm gonna go.
 
Wallace...
 
I understand what you've been through.
 
Stuck in the Speed Force, things you saw... I get it.
 
I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.
 
When you get bucked from the horse,
 
best thing you can do...
 
get right back on the damn thing
 
and ride, Wallace.
 
Ride!
 
Hello, Barry Allen.
 
- How do you... - Know your name?
 
I know a lot of things.
 
And I can do a lot of things too.
 
Wally West made it here too.
 
This is exciting.
 
It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.
 
I'm happy to have you.
 
What do you want with Supergirl?
 
Same thing that I want with both of you.
 
To teach you all a lesson.
 
Is that all you got, Kid Flash?
 
I mean, you look a little scared.
 
And you're too slow.
 
Nighty-night, Flash.

148

我们到底在哪 发生什么了
What is... where the hell are we? What's going on?

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,810
我还想问你来着
I was hoping you could tell me

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,140
为什么我穿得跟奥黛丽赫本一样
or maybe explain to me why I just pulled an Audrey Hepburn

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,930
在夜店唱歌呢
and sang in a nightclub.

152
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,080
-咱俩是在做梦吗  -还是同一个梦
- Maybe we're dreaming? - The same dream?

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,780
对 真是... 在你来这之前
Yeah, that's... What's the last thing you remember

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,830
做的最后一件事是什么
before you got here?

155
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,530
我在超常行动部
I was at the D.E.O.

156
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,420
他们带来一名外星囚犯
They had just brought in an alien prisoner.

157
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,520
他逃了 然后...
He got loose, and...

158
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,810
很奇怪 他有那个红色...
it was really weird. He had this, um, red...

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,610
-手帕  -对
- ... Pocket handkerchief? - Yes!

160
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,880
你在我星球上 昏迷不醒
I saw you on my Earth. You were in a coma.

161
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,470
你男朋友带你来找我们
Your boyfriend brought you to us.

162
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,200
他不是我男朋友
He is not my boyfriend.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,970
他... 就是个毛小子
He... he's just a boy.

164
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,030
也不是我朋友
Who is not my friend.

165
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,150
-啥都不是  -好吧
- He's my nothing. - Okay.

166
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,030
不管他是谁
All right, uh, well, whoever he is

167
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,740
他说有人迷晕了你
said that this guy whammied you,

168
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,950
然后逃到我们星球 接着出现在科学之星实验室
and then he escaped to my Earth, he showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs,

169
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,870
我去追他 想让他把你叫醒
I went after him to try to get him to wake you up...

170
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,430
-然后你就被迷晕了  -是的
- And then you got whammied. - Yeah.

171
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,930
-所以我们现在在哪  -我也不知道
- So where are we? - I don't know.

172
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,030
也许是平行时空 或者是...
I mean, it could be a parallel dimension, or...

173
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,740
复杂的幻想
maybe just some elaborate illusion.

174
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,150
我们得想个办法
We just need to figure a way out.

175
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,840
也许脚跟碰三下就行了[绿野仙踪]
I guess I could click my heels together three times.

176
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,740
-有道理  -我开玩笑呢
- Yeah... - I was kidding.

177
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,170
这样啊 好的...
Okay, all right, well...

178
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,780
快来
Come on. Let's...

179
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,580
顺便啰嗦一句 你唱歌真好听
You're a really good singer, by the way.

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,750
谢了 我姐姐说我名字就取的卡拉ok前俩字
Hey, thanks. My sister says I put the "Kara" in "karaoke."

181
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,610

我叫砍特·莫兰 夜店老板
My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club,

188
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,790

189
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,930

We what now?

190
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,080
我花钱请你唱歌 没让你问问题
I pay you to sing, not pepper me with questions.

191
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,740
我希望你好好选歌
And I hope you got something better in your songbook

192
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,460
而不是在那引吭高歌 金发妞
than what you were belting out up there, blondie.

193
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,270
别叫我金发妞
Hey! Don't call me blondie.

194
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,600
我不知道你是谁...
Hey, look, I don't know who you are...

195
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,020
原来是小刀无影手
obviously you're someone who's quick with a knife.

196
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,680
请原谅我朋友 他说话不过脑
You have to excuse my friend. He doesn't think before he talks.

197
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,120
我侄子也那样
Yeah, I had a cousin like that.

198
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,730
我就割断了他的喉咙
I had to slit his throat too.

199
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,830
格雷迪 让他俩准备一下
Grady! Get these two set up.

我是弹钢琴的
I tickle the keys around here.

208
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,650
你知道他为什么叫“砍爷”吗
Say, you realize how he got the nickname "Cutter," don't you?

209
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,870
-不知道  -因为他喜欢砍人
- No. - Because he likes to cut people.

210
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,470
还是问我吧 他会一直唠下去
You ask me, I think he's all talk.

211
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,230
西斯科 不是西斯科 你好
Cisco... not Cisco. Hello.

I pray that, one day, you do not find out

213
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,480
你会发现自己大错特错 帕布洛
how very, very wrong you are, Pablo.

214
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,140
-干你的活去吧  -好吧

215
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,640
格雷迪不知道 不过总有一天
You see, Grady doesn't know this, but one day,

216
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,370
我会出人头地
I'm gonna be somebody.

217
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,020
一定会的 而且就在
I'm gonna be somebody, and it's gonna happen

218
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,080
那舞台上大放光彩
right there on that stage.

219
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,380
等着瞧 只消一个契机
You'll see. I just need my one shot.

220
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,190
真是越来越有趣了
It's just curiouser and curiouser.

221
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,080
是啊 好像"绿野仙踪"
Yeah, yeah, it's like "The Wizard of Oz."

222
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,780
-是的  -"你在这里
- Yeah. - "And you were there,

223
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,660
-"又在那里"  -不过他们不是真的
- "and you were there...." - Except, it's not really them.

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,630
他们都是音乐剧里的...
They're all playing characters in a...

225
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,440
... 角色
... Musical.


226
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,310
巴里 我们到底在哪
Barry, where are we?

227
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,870
不知道
I don't know.

228
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,400
要知道人们常说...
Well, you know what they say...

229
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,400
演出还得继续
the show must go on!

230
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,550
超女 我喜欢你唱的"月亮河"
Supergirl, I loved your rendition of "Moon River,"

231
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,720
多美的一首歌
such a beautiful song.

232
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,900
有几处唱得很平淡
You were a little flat in places,

233
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,670
但你在台上太可爱了让我不愿打断
but I'm willing to let it slide just because you're so cute.

234
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,280
-等等 你对我们干了什么  -也没什么
- Hold on. What did you do to us? - Oh, nothing much.

235
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,690
不过在你们心中放了一首歌
Just put a little song in your heart.

236
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,250
放了一首...
Put a little...

237
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,520
你为什么带我们来这
Why did you bring us here?

238
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,920
我没带你们去哪儿
I didn't bring you anywhere.

239
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,690
我们在你们脑海里
We're inside your heads.

240
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,450
你们创造了这个世界
You created this world.

241
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,410
算我们幸运 这里也许是战争电影
And we got lucky because it could have been a war movie

242
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,850
或是... 太空歌剧
or a... a space opera,

243
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,850
{\an8}以太空旅行为主题的广播剧 电视剧 电影

244
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,070
但还好你们都热爱歌舞片
but thanks to your love of musicals,

245
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,570
你看过无数次"绿野仙踪"
with the countless times you watched, um, "Wizard of Oz"

246
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,590
-和你的养父母一起...  -你怎么知道
- with your adoptive parents... - How did you know that?

247
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,110
还有你 每个雨夜都和妈妈
And, you, all those rainy nights

248
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,610
看弗雷德·阿斯泰尔和弗兰克·辛纳屈的电影
watching Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra with Mom.

249
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,610
{\an8}两人均为著名歌手 演员

250
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,000
难怪是歌舞片
Well, where else would we be?

251
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,590
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

252
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,800
一击不中
Ooh! Swing and a miss.

253
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,160
我还没说
I didn't tell you.

254
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,790
我本人不在这
I'm not really here.

255
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,280
我还在现实世界
See, I'm out there in the real world.

256
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,170
中心城现在是我的囊中之物
Central City's mine for the taking.

257
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,390
-我们会阻止你  -没错
- Ah. We're gonna stop you. - Yeah!

258
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,550
放马过来
You're welcome to try that.

259
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,290
前提是你们能从这逃出去
If you can get out of here.

260
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,230
我们要怎么逃出去
How do we get out of here?

261
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,320
你们身处一部歌舞片
You're in a movie musical.

262
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,110
所以只要跟着...
So all you have to do is just follow the...

263
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,330
黄砖路[出自绿野仙踪]
The Yellow Brick Road?

264
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,630
不... 是剧本
No, the... the script.

265
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,900
-啊 对  -剧本...
- Oh, yeah. - Script...

266
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,470
剧情结束后
Reach the end of the plot,

267
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,540
妈咪妈咪哄 你们就能回家了
and, presto chango, you get to go home.

268
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,050
不过有件事还得说一下...
One little detail, though, I should mention...

269
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,040
在这里死掉 现实世界你们也活不了
if you die in here, you die out there.

270
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,160
真棒
Lovely.

271
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,170
我简直受够这种魔法怪胎了
I've reached my limit with magical creeps.

272
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,430
现在 我希望你们准备好
In the meantime, I hope you're both ready

273
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,590
放声高歌一曲了
to get the rust off those pipes of yours.

274
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,050
-我们不会为你唱歌  -不会
- We're not singing for you! - No.

275
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,120
永... 永远不会 我是说
Uh, any... anymore, I mean.

276
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,360

Come on, now, maybe just one little

- fun opening number just to... - Leave your jacket on.

不知道
I don't know.

326
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,020
走 我们去找他
Come on, let's find him.

327
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,920
-他消失了  -没错
- He's gone. - Yup.

328
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,750
-现在怎么办  -不知道
- So what do we do now? - I don't know.

329
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,280
大概只能...
I mean, I guess we just...

330
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,780
照他说的做
we do what he says, right?

331
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
我们得弄清楚这部歌舞片的剧情
We have to figure out what the plot of the musical is,

332
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,710
-跟着故事演下去  -好吧 那...
- and we follow the story. - Okay, uh, so...

333
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,640
我们现在什么设定
what do we know so far?

334
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,870
我们是卖唱的
We're singers.

335
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,250
而且老板是黑社会
And apparently we work for a gangster.

336
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,670
没错 还要我们为他单独表演
Yes, who wants us to perform for him.

337
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,680
老实说 也没那么难懂
I mean, honestly, it's pretty straightforward.

338
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,840
-是吗  -对啊
- Right? - Yeah.

339
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,190
你们好
Hello.

340
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,620
你们好 我想念刀枪不入的超能力
Hi! I miss being bulletproof.


341
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,770
-跟我们走  -谁说的
- You're coming with us. - Says who?

342
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,990
我说的
Says me.

343
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,140
巴里 你没事吧
Barry, are you okay?

344
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,060
天啊 快别喊了
Oh, please stop yelling.

345
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,850
我没喊啊
I'm not yelling.

346
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,540
等等 我们这是在哪儿
Wait, where are we?

347
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,200
我也不知道
I don't know.

348
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,590
好吧 别担心 我相信科学之星实验室的每个人
All right, well, I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs

349
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,320
都在想办法救我们出去
is working on getting us out of this.

350
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,150
是啊 多亏他们带我来你的地球
Yeah, I'm glad they brought me to your Earth.

351
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,930
蒙-艾尔看起来真的很在乎你
Mon-El seems like he really cares about you.

352
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,290
蒙-艾尔只在乎他自己
Mon-El only cares about himself.

353
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,540
我们认识9个月他都没告诉我
He lied to me about who he really is

354
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,130
他的真实身份
for nine months.

355
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,680
我没办法原谅他
I can't shake it.

356
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,100
我以为我们会是那种特别的关系
I thought it was gonna be something special

357
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,840
像你和爱瑞斯一样
like what you have with Iris.

358
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
我们...
That is...

359
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,840
分手了
off track.

360
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,140
抱歉
I'm sorry.

361
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,680
我向她求婚了
I asked her to marry me.

362
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,610
真的吗 太好了
You did? That's great.

363
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,940
她肯定同意了吧
Did she not say yes?

364
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,700
是啊 她是同意了 不过我向她求婚的理由
Oh, she said yes, but I guess I did it

365
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,820
不是很正当 我当然是爱她的
for the wrong reason, and, I mean, I love her,

366
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,640
不过我向她求婚是为了要改变未来
but I was trying to change the future.

367
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,130
后来就分开了 想专心救她
Then I pushed her away so I could focus on saving her,

368
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,990
现在简直是一团乱
and it's just a mess now.

369
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,900
还是跑步简单啊
Everything's so simple when I'm running.

370
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
飞行也不难
Or flying.

371
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,760
闭嘴
Shut up!

372
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,200
你们俩都给我闭嘴
Both of you.

373
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,770
斯坦因
Stein?

374
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,940
谁... 谁是斯坦因
Who... who's Stein?

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,740
对 你不是
Right.

376
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,350
-这就是他们  -没错
- This them? - Yeah.

377
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,720
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

378
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,930
反正不是乔·韦斯特
Not Joe West, I'm guessing.

379
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,270
狄格西 狄格西·福斯
Digsy. Digsy Foss.

380
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,230
这城是我的
I run this town.

381
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,920
那你是市长咯
So you're the mayor?

382
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,570
市长虽然赢了选举...
The mayor may have gotten the vote...

383
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,220
不过实权在我手里
but I got the power.

384
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,130
我现在遇到点麻烦...
I got a situation...

385
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,240
你们两个要帮我解决好
that you two are gonna help me with.

386
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,780
-为您办事 荣幸之至  -非常乐意
- We would love to help you with it. - Really love to.

387
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,010
我的女儿 米莉...
My daughter, Millie...

388
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,840
失踪了
she's missing.

389
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,770
最后出现在
Last she was seen,

390
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,570
去往砍特·莫兰夜店的路上
she was heading into Cutter Moran's place.

391
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,790
你们见到她了吗
Have you seen her in there?

392
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,770
-米莉 你是说她叫米莉吗  -是啊 怎么了
- Millie, did you say? - Yeah. Why?

393
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,990
我从没见过她 我没见过她
We haven't seen her. I haven't seen her.

394
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,210
-我没见过她  -是啊 我们...
- I haven't seen her. - Yeah, we...

395
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,550
她是我这一生...
She's the only thing that is good and decent...

396
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,840
唯一的美好
about my life.

397
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,230
如果她有什么三长两短
If anything happened to her,

398
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,280
我就让整个城给她陪葬
this town will run red with blood.

399
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,720
用你俩祭旗
Starting with yours.

400
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,360
我们可不想送死 是吧
We wouldn't want that, now, right?

401
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,920
那我们该如何帮你
So, um, how can we help you?

402
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,260
你俩是砍特的歌手吧
You two sing for Cutter.

403
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,610
-我们是  -是的 我们是
- We sure do. - Yes, we do.

404
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,000
你们到处走走 看能不能找到她
You could poke around and see if you can find her.

405
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,660
你们会帮我吧
So are you gonna do this for me?

406
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,970
怎么办啊
What do we do?

407
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,540
跟着剧本走
Follow the script.

408
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,920
-我们会找到她的 先生  -没错
- We're gonna find her... sir. - Mm-hmm.

409
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,920
很好
Good.

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
好了
Okay.

411
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
就是这儿
This is the place.

412
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,770
4B房间
Apartment 4B.

413
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,830
爱瑞斯就在这儿吗
This is where we can find Iris?

414
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,180
-米莉  -对 米莉
- Millie. - Millie, right.

415
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,890
没错 她就在里面
Yeah, she's in there, all right.

416
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,420
你们两个听着
Now, you two listen to me.

417
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,680
别告诉任何人是我带你们来的
Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.

418
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,940
当然了 我们保证
Oh, yeah, we promise.

419
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,020
聪明人不用多说
Word to the wise.

420
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
你们要还想趟这浑水的话...
You go digging around in this dirt...

421
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,250
可别被门内的场景吓着
you might not like what you find.

422
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,690
好的
Okay.

423
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,060
好了 记住 她或许看起来很像爱瑞斯
Okay, so remember, she might look like Iris,

424
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,690
但她不是
but she is not Iris.

425
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,410
我知道 这一定会很奇怪
I know. This is gonna be weird.

426
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,550
可不是嘛
Yeah, tell me about it.

427
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,280
算我走运 没碰上长得像蒙-艾尔的人
I'm glad we haven't seen someone that looks like Mon-El.

428
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,120
不然我可能真要揍他一拳玩玩儿
I'd probably just punch him in the face for the fun of it.

429
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,700
哦 天啊
Oh, my God!

430
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,420
是她
That's her.

431
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,650
她好像有麻烦了
Sounds like she's in trouble.

432
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,960
好了 往后点 我要破门而入了
Here, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door in.

433
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,620
你往后点 我来踹门
You stand back, I'll kick the door in.

434
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
我没有性别歧视你
Well, I didn't mean, like, a gender thing.

435
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,090
-我只想踹门而已  -巴里
- I just wanted to kick it in... - Barry!

436
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,390
好吧 一起 总行了吧
All right, together. All right?

437
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,080
-一 二  -三
- One, two... - Three!

438
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,700
这是什么鬼
What the hell is going on?

439
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,430
好吧 被你们抓到了
All right, you caught us.

440
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,920
我们谈恋爱了
We're in love.

441
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,290
太恶心了
Ugh, gross.

442
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,930
伙计们 我们有麻烦了
Guys, we have a problem.

443
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,470
好吧 是个新麻烦
Well, another problem.

444
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,940
巴里细胞中的神速力
The Speed Force levels in Barry's cells

445
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,330
严重减少
have been severely depleted,

446
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,720
卡拉身体里的太阳辐射也是
as has the amount of solar radiation in Kara's body.

447
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,360
这是什么意思
What exactly does that mean?

448
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,120
他们的能力在消失
They're being drained.

449
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,800
把他们迷晕的人...
The guy who did this to them...

450
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,000
他是在偷取他们的能力
I think he's stealing their powers.

451
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,850
能力启动
Power up.

452
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,780
我们得把他抓住
We gotta bring him in.

453
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,640
不用 我自己去就行
No, not we... me.

454
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,460
是我害的巴里被迷晕的
I'm the reason Barry got whammied.

455
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,110
不管输赢 我们都要同心协力
We win and we lose as a team.

456
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,370
我跟你一起去
I'm coming with you.

457
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,990
我也去
I'm coming too.

458
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,610
听我说 约翰
Look, J'onn, uh,

459
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,500
虽然我敬你是个特工
I respect this whole special agent situation you got going on,

460
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,090
但眼下这个局面需要
but this problem right here needs someone with...

461
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,930
绿皮肤穿超酷斗篷的人
green skin and sick-ass cape.

462
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,280
叫我火星猎人
Call me the Martian Manhunter.

463
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,020
发现了吧 约翰其实是
I think you'll find that J'onn's a lot more than...

464
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,590
帅外惠中
just a pretty face.

465
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,050
伙计们
Guys!

466
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,430
你好啊
Hello.

467
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,660
巴里和卡拉的生命体征波动很大
Also, Barry and Kara's vitals are all over the place.

468
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,190
我们走
Let's go.

469
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,800
行动吧
All right.

470
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,320
朋友们 你们好
Hello, friends!

471
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,840
闪电小子
Kid Flash.

472
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,600
真高兴看到你来凑热闹
Oh, I'm so glad you could join the party.

473
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,500
我可是你的大粉丝 不过说实话
I'm such a huge fan of your work, but I have to say,

474
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,010
你最近的表现都不在状态
recently, your work's been a bit off.

475
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,180
你知道我在说什么吧
You know what I'm talking about?

476
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,130
我猜神速力里发生的故事
I think maybe it's just that you're a little scared...

477
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,970
把你震住了
from what happened in the Speed Force.

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
对吧
Is that it?

479
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,910
不对
No,

480
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,580
我现在已经无所畏惧了
and I'm not afraid of anything.

481
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,470
拭目以待吧
Prove it.

482
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,740
西斯科 他们朝着第四大道和白杨路方向去了
Uh, Cisco, they're headed towards 4th and Aspen.

483
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,940
收到
Got it.

484
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,200
这边走
This way.

485
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,260
接下来 约翰
All right, J'onn,

486
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,130
要不要来个强强联手啊
how do you feel about a little one-two combo?

487
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,760
我这就打开一个缺口 你做好准备
I'm gonna open a breach, you be ready to hit something

488
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,200
对准另一头全力出击
really hard on the B-side.

489
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,770
往死里打 我擅长
Hitting hard, I can do.

490
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,310
沃利 准备好在地面发起攻击
Wally, get ready to do the same thing on the ground level.

491
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,850
收到
Copy.

492
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,660
动手
Now!

493
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,650
做个好梦
Nighty-night.

494
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
你是们谁啊
Hey, who are you?

495
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,240
快说你们叫什么
Your names, now.

496
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,710
我叫卡拉 他是巴里
I'm Kara. This is Barry.

497
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,700
我们都在你父亲的夜总会唱歌
We're singers at your dad's nightclub.

498
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,440
是的 米莉 你父亲还以为你被绑架了
Yeah, Millie, your dad thinks you've been kidnapped.

499
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,390
好吧 很明显他弄错了
Well, clearly he's mistaken.

500
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,090
他特别想让你回家
He really wants you to come home.

501
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,350
-听着 我才不会回去呢  -嗯哼
- Listen, I am never going back there. - Mm-mm.

502
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,620
为什么不 没有地方比家更好
Why not? There's no place like home.

503
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,730
汤米·莫兰在哪里
Tommy Moran...

504
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,420
哪里就是家
is my home.

505
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,230
再说了 要是老头子们撞破我们的恋情
And besides, if our geezers ever caught wind of this,

506
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,570
肯定又是一场恶战
they'd go to war.

507
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,900
不只是我们的恋情要走向终结
It'd be the end of more than just us, huh?

508
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,670
对 汤米说得没错
Yeah, Tommy's right.

509
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,560
我们的父亲是死对头
Our fathers hate each other.

510
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,770
我们这是禁忌之恋
Our love is forbidden.

511
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,010
这就是"西区故事"[禁忌恋电影]的情节
This is just like "West Side Story."

512
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,570
我觉得更像"异想天开"[音乐剧] 不过...
I was thinking more "Fantasticks," but...

513
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,620
听好了 重点就是
Look, the point is...

514
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,180
我们绝不会走漏风声
we ain't telling nobody nothing.

515
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,480
你们也要守口如瓶 懂了吗
And neither are you, capisce?

516
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,980
懂了
"Capisce."

517
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,370
能让我们单独聊聊吗
Can you give us a second?

518
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,480
可以
Sure.

519
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,460
他说我们要按着剧本演
Okay, look, he says we need to follow the script.

520
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,710
对吧 我们在歌舞剧里
Right? We're in a musical.

521
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,100
我想着若是能说服他们
So I think if we convince them

522
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,490
向各自的父亲坦白恋情
to tell their fathers that they're in love,

523
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,700
也许我们就能从这里逃出去了
maybe that'll get us out of here.

524
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,370
回去继续做...
And back home to being...

525
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,340
单身狗 真好...
single, yay...

526
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,740
至少我们俩能一起单
At least we'll be single together.

527
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,750
这么说真的能安慰人吗
Has saying that ever made anyone feel better?

528
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,210
不好说
Debatable.

529
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,200
好了 听着...
Okay, so look...

530
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,750
你们的父亲都不是完美无缺 对吧
your fathers aren't perfect, right?

531
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
爱情也不是完美无缺
Love isn't perfect.

532
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,080
不是 但是不能因为爱上一个人
No, but you can't let your love for somebody

533
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,890
就为尚未发生之事而担惊受怕
cause you to be afraid of what might happen.

534
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,900
不论如何 好坏都要一起承受
You gotta take the good with the bad, no matter what.

535
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,230
-说的对  -这就意味着...
- Right. - And that includes...

536
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,050
要向你们的父亲坦白彼此之间的爱意
telling your fathers how you two feel about each other.

537
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,390
好了 你说的有道理
All right, you make a convincing argument.

538
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,430
-确实  -我们会去说
- You do. - We'll do it.

539
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,590
我们会坦白恋情 不是吗
We'll tell them about us, right?

540
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,750
好啊 我们现在就去
Well, we should go now.

541
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,380
-哇 多谢啦 小子  -好吧
- Gee, thanks, kid. - Okay.

542
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,600
-为了你  -谢谢你
- For you. - Thank you.

543
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,710
好吧...
Okay, uh...

544
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,340
歌舞剧里说服人真是...
convincing people in musicals is...

545
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,120
-... 太太太容易了  -是啊
- ... really easy. - Yeah.

546
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,080
希望从这里出去也这么容易
Let's hope getting out of one is just as easy.

547
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,790
看吧
Digsy!

548
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,330
她回来了
She's back!

549
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,290
谢天谢地你没事
Thank God you're safe.

550
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,910
我当然没事啦
Oh, of course I'm safe.

551
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,840
巴里和卡拉告诉我 你派他们去找我
Barry and Kara told me that you sent them to find me.

552
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,270
我们都很担心你
We were concerned.

553
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,550
老爸们 有什么好担心的啊
Dads, there's no reason to be concerned.

554
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,040
"老爸们"
"Dads"?

555
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,170
你有意见啊
You got a problem with that?

556
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,450
没
No.

557
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,850
我热爱歌舞剧
I love musicals, so...

558
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,350
好吧
Okay...

559
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,290
听我说 老爸们 有件事
Look, Dads, there's something that...

560
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,600
我得告诉你们
I need to tell you.

561
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,190
我谈恋爱啦
I'm in love!

562
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,130
那个幸运的小子是谁啊
Who is the, uh... the lucky boy?

563
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,540
汤米·莫兰
Tommy Moran.

564
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,220
你... 你是指砍特·莫兰的小子？
You... you mean Cutter Moran's kid?

565
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,930
老爸 听着 我们非常相爱
Dad, look, we're in love.

566
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,980
-真是见鬼  -他就是个小流氓
- The hell you are. - He's a hooligan!

567
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,640
他父亲是个流氓
His father's a hooligan.

568
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,930
他母亲是个...
His mother is...

569
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,730
不要在女儿面前说
Not in front of the girl.

570
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,450
我不准你和他在一起
And you're not loving that boy.

571
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,760
你疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

572
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,290
她是敌人的女儿
She is the daughter of my enemy.

573
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,150
狄格西·福斯就是个肮脏下流的无赖
Digsy Foss is a dirty, rotten scoundrel,

574
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,760
他女儿也不会是什么好东西...
and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...

575
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,230
老爸 听我解释
Dad, if you just let me explain.

576
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,210
没什么好解释的 汤米
There's nothing to explain, Tommy.

577
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,200
我知道你一直有什么瞒着我
I knew you were keeping something from me.

578
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,050
没想到竟是这个
I never imagined it was something like this!

579
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,690
她不再是你们的小公主了
She isn't your little girl anymore.

580
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,970
她长大了
Well, she isn't.

581
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,530
她是个非常勇敢 强大的女人
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.

582
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,350
只要你们认真看就能看到
One look, and you can see that.

583
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,580
她希望能和他在一起
And she wants to be with him.

584
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,680
不论告诉你们需要多大的勇气
No matter how scared she was to tell you,

585
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,380
不论和他在一起会有多么危险
no matter how dangerous it is to be with him,

586
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,990
最重要的是 他们与彼此在一起
all that matters is, they're together.

587
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,460
当你遇到这样的爱情
And when you find a love like that, well...

588
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,910
一定要紧紧握住它
you gotta hold on to it.

589
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,200
无论谁阻止你
No matter who's trying to stop you.

590
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,450
我对这点深信不疑
That's clear to me now.

591
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,270
我觉得你对你儿子有些太过严厉了
I think you're being a little tough on your son.

592
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,430
什么
Excuse me?

593
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,750
他为什么不马上告诉你 显而易见嘛
Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.

594
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,210
看看你现在的反应
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

595
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,350
也许你只要静下心来... 听听他解释
Maybe if you just listen and... and hear his reasons

596
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,690
试着设身处地为他考虑...
and try to see things from his point of view...

597
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,090
也许... 也许你就能理解为什么
maybe... maybe you'd understand why

598
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,260
他从前会...
he didn't tell you...

599
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,700
瞒着你
before now.

600
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,220
宝贝女儿 这一切...
Baby doll, it's just...

601
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,740
你永远无法理解为人父亲的焦虑
you'll never understand what it means to be a father.

602
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,430
米莉 亲爱的 我们会一直照顾着你
Millie, my darling, we've always taken care of you.

603
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,910
我们只希望你幸福

我好爱好爱你们
I love you both so much.

641
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,170
我们也爱你
We love you.

642
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,740
谢了
Thanks.

643
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,120
好了...
Okay...

644
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,690
你想干嘛
So what do you want to do?

645
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,480
叫上兄弟们
Gather up the boys.

646
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,630
-要开战了  -我就知道
- We're going to war. - I had a feeling.

647
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,130
我很赞赏你的诚恳 儿子
I appreciate your honesty, son.

648
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,380
-谢谢 老爸  -过来
- Thanks, Dad. - Come here.

649
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,400
召集人手
Get the boys.

650
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,850
准备开战
We are going to war.

651
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,960
果然是我最希望
if it isn't the two people

652
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,770
见到的两个人
I was hoping would visit me the most.

653
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,040
马上叫醒他们
Fix them. Now.

654
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,240
抱歉 我做不到
I'm sorry. I can't.

655
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,810
如果你还希望在有生之年从这牢房里出去
If you ever want to get out of that cell,

656
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
那就赶紧叫醒他们
that's exactly what you're gonna do.

657
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,270
你没听懂
You don't get it.

658
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,020
你没明白 大个子
You don't understand, big guy.

659
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,260
这是没法改变的
That's just not how it works.

660
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,460
我也无能为力
My powers don't work that way.

661
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,870
什么意思 是你让他们变成这样的
What do you mean? You're the one who did this to them.

662
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,430
没错 但是...
Yes, but...

663
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,840
他们的命运
they are the only ones that are in control

664
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,560
现在由他们自己掌控
of what happens to them now,

665
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,690
就像你们两一样
as are the two of you.

666
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,980
我们 什么意思
Us? What does that mean?

667
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,580
你有...
How much...

668
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,940
多爱他 爱瑞斯
do you love him, Iris?

669
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,080
还有你 蒙·艾尔 你爱她吗
And you, Mon-El, how much do you love her?

670
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,920
所以问题就是
So the question is:

671
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,250
你们的爱能否强大到救出他们
is that strong enough to save them?

672
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,030
你们想让卡拉和巴里从那个世界回来
You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in,

673
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,960
就凭自己的力量去救他们
you can go get them yourselves.

674
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,080
你们有那份力量
You have that power.

675
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,610
怎么做
How?

676
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,240
恕难相告 抱歉 你们得自己琢磨出来
Ah, I can't tell you. Sorry, you gotta figure it out yourself.

677
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,860
现在 如果你们不介意的话 我要在这个
Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna just chill

678
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,640
金碧辉煌的小牢房里休息了
in this wonderfully decorated little cell of yours.

679
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,100
再见了 朋友们
Bye, guys!

680
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,220
祝你们好运 爱会告诉你们方法的
Good luck. Love will find a way.

681
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,080
你们可以做到的 爱的力量是无穷的
You can do it. Power of love and all that.

682
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,680
我们现在该做什么 我们让...
What do we do now? We got...

683
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,880
米莉和汤米...
we got Millie and Tommy

684
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,360
告诉了他们的父亲他们在一起了
to tell their fathers that they're in love.

685
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,820
虽然我知道是在歌舞剧里
Which, I know we're in a musical and everything,

686
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,300
但看见蒙·艾尔和别人在一起...
but seeing Mon-El in love with someone else was...

687
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,650
看着很不爽 我懂
It was hard to watch. I know.

688
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,620
不管了 我们现在...
Anyway, I mean, what are we...

689
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,790
怎么办 你觉得这所谓的...
supposed to do? What do you think this...

690
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,990
音乐大师到底要我们干嘛
Music Meister needs us to do now?

692
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,830
终于找到你们了
Ah, there you are!

693
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,000
准备好了吗
You two ready?

694
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,630
准备啥来着...
Ready for...

695
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,220
排练啊 笨蛋
For rehearsal, you dolt.

696
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,170
莫兰先生说你有很多原创歌曲
Mr. Moran told me that you got more songs in your repertoire.

697
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,040
我们要演完音乐剧
We have to finish the musical.

698
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,810
-是啊  -那你...
- Yeah. - Uh, do you...

699
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,980
你有原创曲子吗
do you happen to know anything original?

700
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,840
不骗你们
As a matter of fact,

701
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,350
我整天都在创作
I've been working on something all day..

703
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,990
-音乐剧里真轻松  -可不是
- Things really are easier in musicals. - Yeah.

704
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,910

Oh, my God.!

759

I don't think it works that way.

768
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,350

You sent me into the Speed Force.

769

802
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,880
简直是精彩绝伦
Beautiful.

803
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,670
大兄弟 你怎么逃出来的
Man, how did you get out of the cell?

804
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,670
西斯科 你真觉得那牢房
Cisco, do you really think that cell

805
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,940
能困住我吗
is gonna just, like, hold me?

806
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,070
所以这是... 发生了什么
No, I'm sorry... what's going on?

807
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,630
为什么这么做
Why did you do this to us?

808
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,620
因为我相信你们是正直的人
I did it because I believe in the good guys.

809
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,110
我们初次见面就说了
I told you when we first met.

810
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,420
要给你们好好上一课
It was to teach all of you a lesson.

811
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,120
我眼观世界
'Cause I see everything,

812
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,980
看到了两个人...
and I saw two people...

813
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,250
承受着心碎之苦
with two broken hearts.

814
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,410
所以你说的课是...
So the lesson was...

815
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,290
是爱啊 超级少女
Love, Supergirl.

816
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,260
爱的意义是...
Love is about...

817
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,560
等待他人的救赎
letting yourself be saved.

818
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,630
爱并不仅仅是帮助他人
It's not just about saving other people.

819
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,200
虽然你们都是超级英雄
Even if you are superheroes.

820
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,780
总之 非常抱歉 给你们制造了不少麻烦
Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.

821
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,660
我只是想让你们进入自己的角色
I was just trying to get you to play the game,

822

823
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,770

824
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,800

Earth-multi-verse... universe, something?

825
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,520
是啊 你...
Yeah, you...

826
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,050
我说了你们也不会懂的
you wouldn't even understand where I come from.

827
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,210
那就这样了吗
Wait, I'm sorry, that's it?

828
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,080
你就是为了给我们上一课吗
You're just gonna teach somebody else a lesson?

829
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,330

845
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,740
讲真 唱得好的可不止我一个

850
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,720
毕竟她是超级少女
Well, her name is Supergirl.

851
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,220
所以她无所不能
It's kind of implied, right?

852
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,800

Well, we better be getting going.

853
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,340

I promised Kara's sister we'd get her back in one piece.

854

865
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,330
我不能这么做
I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.

866
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,970
过去的三年 我们经历了太多太多
You know, we've been through a lot these last three years,

867
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,800
但是...
but, um...

868
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,990
怎么就被困在音乐剧里了
getting stuck in a musical?

869
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,630
音乐大师...
Music Meister...

870
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,280
说什么剧都有可能
said that, you know, it could've been anything,

871
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,840
我创造了那个世界...
that I created that world because...

872
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,660
因为你是那个观众
You were watching them.

873
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,710
是因为我们的爱
Because of us.

874
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,260
我母亲曾说 音乐剧拥有一种
My mom used to always say that musicals have the power

875
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,320
治愈一切的力量
to make everything better.

876
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,270
